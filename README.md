# Trovo Plugin for Grayjay
Hi, here I am again with an attempt to add a new source for [Grayjay](https://grayjay.app/), this time is [Trovo](https://trovo.live/)
Right now this doesn't have anything more than the Live Chat (Webview). but I'll be building it up

Also... sorry for having A LOT of Allowed URLs, I don't know what urls are being used, I just grabbed everything I found on both DevTools Network's and Sources Tab
